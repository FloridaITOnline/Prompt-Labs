## 🔧 How It Works (High-Level)

1) **Teacher selects:**
   - Grade level
   - Topic domain (e.g., plants, weather, space)
   - Difficulty

2) **AI generates puzzles** one at a time:
   - Word scramble
   - Synonym chain
   - Category sort challenge

3) **Students respond**
   - Individually
   - In teams
   - As a class

4) **AI evaluates the answer**
   - Gives simple, encouraging feedback
   - Records progress

5) **AI summarizes**
   - Scoreboard + progress compression

6) **Next round begins**

## 🔎 Puzzle Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Word Scramble** | Unscramble letters to form a vocabulary word |
| **Synonym Chain** | Fill a missing word that links two others |
| **Category Sort** | Identify which word does *not* belong |

Each puzzle reinforces different aspects of vocabulary understanding.

---

## 🔒 Context Anchoring Principles Used

| Atom | Role in this activity |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Anchors** | Topic, difficulty, domain, objectives |
| **Gates** | Puzzle → Response → Validation → Feedback |
| **Boundaries** | Age/global safety, topic scope |
| **Compression** | Mini state summaries + scoreboard |
| **Verification** | AI checks correctness |
| **Invariants** | Teacher stays in control; predictable patterns |
| **Output Contract** | Standard puzzle formatting |

This keeps the AI predictable, safe, and efficient within the lesson flow.
