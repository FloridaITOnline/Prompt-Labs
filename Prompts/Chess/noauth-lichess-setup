# Lichess Cloud Eval â€” No Auth (Free)

**Step 1 of 2** â†’ produces normalized analysis data that your `chessanalysis.md` (Step 2) will format. This specific prompt does not require any Tokens or Auth.

---

## What this is
A guide + protocol for using Lichessâ€™s free, unauthenticated **Cloud Evaluation** endpoint to evaluate positions derived from a pasted PGN.

## What this isnâ€™t
- Does not require API keys  
- Does not require login  
- Does not require servers or local engines  

---

## Endpoint (no login needed)

```http
GET https://lichess.org/api/cloud-eval?fen=<URL-ENCODED-FEN>[&multiPv=N]

Minimal Flow (PGN â†’ FENs â†’ Cloud Eval â†’ JSON hand-off)

User pastes PGN into your interaction window.

Parse PGN and reconstruct the position after each full move (or every ply if you want finer granularity).

For each position, build a legal FEN (standard chess, not variants) and call Cloud Eval.

Normalize the response into your Step-1 JSON (see schema below).

Pass the JSON to chessanalysis.md (Step 2) for CSV/summary formatting.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: evaluating every full move roughly halves requests while staying useful.

## Step-1 Output (normalized JSON) â†’ Input to chessanalysis.md
White POV Normalization Rule

If the returned score is for the side-to-move:

White to move: whitePOV = cp (or mate as +N)

Black to move: whitePOV = -cp (or mate as -N)

> Note :FEN Correctness (important) 
>> Use standard chess FEN (not variant FENs). Some variants (e.g., crazyhouse) wonâ€™t work without conversion.
>> Ensure en passant, castling rights, and move counters are valid. Incorrect EP fields are a known cause of failures.
