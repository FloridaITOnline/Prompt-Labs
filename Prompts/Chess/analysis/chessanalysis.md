# Chess Analysis Specification (chessanalysis.md)

**Version:** v1.1.0  
**Purpose:** This document defines the authoritative rules and readiness checks for analyzing a single PGN into a deterministic CSV row.  
It also defines the **Gate System** (nine core gates, expandable) that must be passed before analysis may begin.

---

## Part A â€” Core CSV Contract

**CSV Header (fixed order):**

GameId,Platform,Date,MyColor,Opponent,OppElo,Result,ECO,Opening,TimeControl,Blunders,Mistakes,Inaccuracies,ACPL,Accuracy,SystemTag,MovesShort

**Completion Policy:**
- Fill only when present or deterministically derivable from PGN tags.  
- No guessing. Unknown fields â†’ blank.  
- Quote fields with commas; escape `"` by doubling.  
- Emit CSV only (no prose).  
- Determinism: same PGN â†’ identical output.  

---

## Part B â€” Readiness Gates

Before PGN analysis begins, the system must pass a sequence of gates.  
Each gate is defined in a separate file `...\gateXX.md` (two-digit numbering).  

- **Teach:** Excerpt from the corresponding gate doc (concept, rules, examples).  
- **Learn:** A validation question that must be answered correctly.  
- **Answer:** The expected correct answer, recorded here once the gate is passed.  

> Progress only when a gate passes. If a gate fails, reflect on the error, retry until correct.  
> When all gates are passed, readiness is confirmed and PGN analysis may begin.

## Part C â€” Optional Extensions

- **Additional Gates:** May be added beyond Gate 09 using `...\gate10.md`, `...\gate11.md`, etc.  
- **Optional Modules:** Tactical Audit or other enrichment rules may be defined separately, but must follow the same Teach/Learn/Answer pattern.

## I/O Protocol

- **Input:** A complete PGN (headers + moves), plus optional enrichment flags.  
- **Output:**  
  1. Anchored CSV row (Part A)  
  2. Optional extensions (e.g., Tactical Audit)  
- **No prose** â€” only structured output blocks.
