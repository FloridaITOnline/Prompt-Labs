# Chess Analysis (Context Anchoring)

Purpose : Demonstrates context anchoring by analyzing chess games.  
** See parent README for technique overview.

‚ö†Ô∏è API Key Safety  
Your account = your responsibility. Never paste keys here.  
Use exports if you prefer. If you‚Äôre just experimenting, skip to **Quickstart** below 
and use PGN exports (no keys required).

---

## Quickstart (No API Key Needed)
1. Export games (Lichess / Chess.com / Chessis)  
2. Map them into a context block  
3. Run the analysis prompt  

*(If you later want to connect accounts directly, see **Account Connections** below.)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Account Connections

If you plan to use Lichess, Chess.com, or Chessis with these examples, please see the 
[Account Setup Guide](../account-setup.md).

- [**Lichess Setup**](../lichess/account-lichess-setup.md): Requires a free account + personal API token.  
- [**Chess.com Setup**](../chessdotcom/account-chessdotcom-setup.md): Uses the public API (no login needed for most data).  
- [**Chessis Setup**](../chessis/account-chessis-setup.md): Chessis is an Android app, but can also run on Windows using Google Play.  
  Installation requires a free Google (Gmail) account. The app itself is free.  
  Use the built-in PGN export feature to generate game files for analysis.  

üîë You are 100% in control of your accounts and connections. This repo never collects, 
stores, or manages your credentials.

‚öôÔ∏è Capability & Fetch Modes (RAG-friendly)

Some assistants can‚Äôt call HTTP or read local files. This project supports two modes:

Paste-Mode (default, no keys): Export your games (PGN/JSON) from Lichess / Chess.com / Chessis and paste them below the prompt.

Direct-Fetch Mode (optional): If your assistant supports web calls and you provide an Account Card with consent, it may fetch via the platforms‚Äô published endpoints.

RAG required (for continuity): After normalization, save the emitted CSV/JSONL to your own storage (e.g., Git repo). In later sessions/tools, re-anchor by pasting those rows back into context. That‚Äôs your portable ‚Äúmemory‚Äù across Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.

## Next Steps
- [General Account Setup Guide](../account-setup.md)  
- [Example Prompts](../ChessAnalysis.md)  
- Chat about your games! You can export analyses and keep them for your personal portfolio.  
  In another lab, we will demonstrate how to use the output from `ChessAnalysis.md` to track 
  your own portfolio locally in your Git repository.
