# Chess Analysis (Context Anchoring)

Purpose : Demonstrates context anchoring by analyzing chess games.  
** See parent README for technique overview.

‚ö†Ô∏è API Key Safety  
Your account = your responsibility. Never paste keys here.  
Use exports if you prefer. If you‚Äôre just experimenting, skip to **Quickstart** below 
and use PGN exports (no keys required).

---

## Quickstart (Auto-Fetch; No Auth)

1. Open **`./quickstart/quickstart.md`** and copy its contents into your assistant‚Äôs context window.  
2. Paste your **single-game PGN** when prompted.

> Uses the free Lichess **Cloud Eval** endpoint (no tokens/accounts). Subject to rate limits per IP.  
> Connecting a Lichess account does **not** raise Cloud Eval limits, but it can enable faster authenticated game exports and other features‚Äîsee **Account Connections**.

---

## Using Other Setups

1. **Pick a setup** from `./setup/`:
   - `noauth-lichess-setup.md` ‚Äî *no login*, paste PGN, Cloud Eval only.
   - `lichess-account-setup.md` ‚Äî requires **LICHESS_USERNAME** + **LICHESS_TOKEN**; lets you fetch your games and may allow higher export throughput.
   - `chessdotcom-setup.md` ‚Äî requires **CHESSCOM_USERNAME** (public data; no token).
   - `chessis-setup.md` ‚Äî export PGN from the app; no token.

2. **Edit placeholders** (example):
   ```md
   LICHESS_USERNAME: your_username
   LICHESS_TOKEN: your_personal_token_here
```
Do not commit tokens; prefer ephemeral sessions.

Copy into your context window in this order:

the chosen ./setup/...md

./analysis/chessanalysis.md

Run it, then paste a single-game PGN
(or let the account setup fetch games if it supports direct export).

>Tip: If something fails (fetch/rate limits), fall back to paste-mode by exporting PGNs and re-running with noauth-lichess-setup.md.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Account Connections

If you plan to use Lichess, Chess.com, or Chessis with these examples, please see the 
[Account Setup Guide](../account-setup.md).

- [**Lichess Setup**](../lichess/account-lichess-setup.md): Requires a free account + personal API token.  
- [**Chess.com Setup**](../chessdotcom/account-chessdotcom-setup.md): Uses the public API (no login needed for most data).  
- [**Chessis Setup**](../chessis/account-chessis-setup.md): Chessis is an Android app, but can also run on Windows using Google Play.  
  Installation requires a free Google (Gmail) account. The app itself is free.  
  Use the built-in PGN export feature to generate game files for analysis.  

üîë You are 100% in control of your accounts and connections. This repo never collects, 
stores, or manages your credentials.

‚öôÔ∏è Capability & Fetch Modes (RAG-friendly)

Some assistants can‚Äôt call HTTP or read local files. This project supports two modes:

Paste-Mode (default, no keys): Export your games (PGN/JSON) from Lichess / Chess.com / Chessis and paste them below the prompt.

Direct-Fetch Mode (optional): If your assistant supports web calls and you provide an Account Card with consent, it may fetch via the platforms‚Äô published endpoints.

RAG required (for continuity): After normalization, save the emitted CSV/JSONL to your own storage (e.g., Git repo). In later sessions/tools, re-anchor by pasting those rows back into context. That‚Äôs your portable ‚Äúmemory‚Äù across Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.

## Next Steps
- [General Account Setup Guide](../account-setup.md)  
- [Example Prompts](../ChessAnalysis.md)  
- Chat about your games! You can export analyses and keep them for your personal portfolio.  
  In another lab, we will demonstrate how to use the output from `ChessAnalysis.md` to track 
  your own portfolio locally in your Git repository.
