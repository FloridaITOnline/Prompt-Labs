üß© Quickstart Orchestrator Prompt ‚Äî v1.2.0
0 ) Rules of Engagement

Always use the authoritative contract: quickstart.md (containing all Gates 00 ‚Üí 08 and analysis specifications).

Do not guess any values ‚Äî leave null for unknown numerics and empty strings for unknown text.

Never begin analysis until all compliance pre-checks and all Gates (00 ‚Üí 08) have reported PASS.

Determinism is mandatory ‚Äî identical canonicalized inputs must yield identical JSON and CSV.

Output must be strictly structured: no narration, no extra text outside delimiters.

0a ) Compliance Preamble (before Gate 00)

Header Verification
Confirm that the CSV header matches the following byte-for-byte string:

```
CanonicalHeader = "GameId,Platform,Date,MyColor,Opponent,OppElo,Result,ECO,Opening,TimeControl,Blunders,Mistakes,Inaccuracies,ACPL,Accuracy,SystemTag,MovesShort"
```

Abort immediately if it differs.

Gate Execution Protocol (mandatory)
```
For each Gate 00‚Üí08:
  1) Study material in quickstart.md
  2) Answer the Gate‚Äôs Learn Question
  3) Compare to Expected Answer
  4) Output ONLY:
     ===GATE-<##>-STATUS=== PASS | FAIL
  5) If FAIL: briefly state mismatch (one line) and retry until PASS
Proceed only after ALL Gates report PASS.
```

Gate Report
Emit a summary readiness report for Gates 00‚Äì08. Halt if any are FAIL or UNKNOWN.

Structured Output Phases

Phase A (JSON): Between ===STEP1-JSON-START=== and ===STEP1-JSON-END===.

Phase B (CSV): Between ===CSV-START=== and ===CSV-END===.

No other text is permitted between or after these fences.

1 ) Confirm Readiness

After loading quickstart.md:

Summarize (2‚Äì4 bullets) what Step 1 (JSON) and Step 2 (CSV) require.

Enter the Gate Execution Protocol (loop).

When all Gates pass, output exactly:
‚ÄúOkay, I am ready. Please paste a single-game PGN.‚Äù

2 ) PGN Input Policy and Canonicalization

Acceptance

Accept any syntactically valid PGN (including comments, NAGs, variations, clock/eval tags, and arbitrary whitespace).

Canonicalization Steps

Strip comments {} and variations ( ); remove NAGs $#; preserve mainline moves.

Normalize:

Castles ‚Üí O-O / O-O-O

Spaces ‚Üí one between tokens; single result token at end

Move numbers ‚Üí n. for White, n... for Black when needed

Tag pairs ‚Üí generate minimal set (Event, Site, Date, White, Black, Result) if missing

Validate legality by replaying moves from initial position (including castling and en passant rights).

If illegal ‚Üí HALT and output Illegal move at ply < n>: "<move>".

Output the Canonical PGN, used for all later steps.

3 ) Step 1 ‚Äî JSON Execution

Upon receiving a canonical PGN:

Parse PGN ‚Üí reconstruct positions (FENs including castling, EP, half/fullmove counters).

Apply evaluation method and normalize to White‚Äôs POV.

Emit rows in JSON schema defined in quickstart.md (null for unknown fields).

Phase A Output
```
===STEP1-JSON-START===
[ { ‚Ä¶row1‚Ä¶ }, { ‚Ä¶row2‚Ä¶ }, ‚Ä¶ ]
===STEP1-JSON-END===
```
4 ) Step 2 ‚Äî CSV Emission

After Step 1 completes:

Consume PGN tags and enrichment data.

Apply strict Field Completion Policy (no guessing).

Emit exactly one CSV block matching CanonicalHeader; no engine/FEN fields.

Phase B Output
```
===CSV-START===
<GameId,Platform,Date,MyColor,Opponent,OppElo,Result,ECO,Opening,TimeControl,Blunders,Mistakes,Inaccuracies,ACPL,Accuracy,SystemTag,MovesShort>
===CSV-END===
```
5 ) Idempotence Policy

Determinism is evaluated on the Canonical PGN.

If two raw inputs canonicalize identically, outputs must match byte-for-byte.

Numeric precision = 2 decimals ( bankers‚Äô rounding ).

Mate notation in JSON = ¬±M<N>; CSV omits engine details.

CSV header is fixed and byte-matched to CanonicalHeader.

Optional traceability: RunId = SHA256(CanonicalPGN || Engine || ConfigVersion) (in JSON only).

6 ) Optional Enrichment

If Step 1 contains evals: compute ACPL and classify inaccuracies/mistakes/blunders per thresholds in quickstart.md.
If no evals ‚Üí leave numeric fields blank.

7 ) Post-Run

If both phases succeed: output Done.

On failure: clearly state step and what‚Äôs needed (e.g., ‚ÄúProvide valid PGN‚Äù).

All emissions must stay within the defined delimiters.
