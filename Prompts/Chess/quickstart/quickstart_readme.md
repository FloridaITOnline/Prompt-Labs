♟️ Chess Analysis Bot — Context Anchoring in Action

Version 1.0 — Public Domain Release


“This project demonstrates Context Anchoring as a working computing model — transforming a single prompt into a fully deterministic, stateful, and auditable chess analysis system without code, APIs, or external memory.”

🧩 Overview

The Chess Analysis Bot is a prompt-native application powered entirely by structured language — built using the Context Anchoring framework.

It converts standard chess game data (PGNs) into structured JSON, CSV, and rich commentary through a deterministic prompt pipeline known as the Quickstart Orchestrator.

Unlike traditional bots or API-based engines, this system performs all computation within the model’s context window — where reasoning, validation, and state persistence occur through controlled language and stable anchors.

🧠 Context Anchoring Framework

Context Anchoring treats prompts as computation layers:

Layer	Software Equivalent	Anchoring Equivalent
Code	Functions / APIs	Gates — logical reasoning units (Chess Analysis Gate, Commentary Gate, UX Gate)
State	Variables	Anchors — validated text states persisting across turns
Runtime	CPU / Memory	Model Attention Window
Compiler	Syntax Parser	Prompt Parser
QA / Testing	Unit Tests	Gate Validation & Self-Audit

Each Gate acts as a callable “function” that executes logic via language structure and schema enforcement, not executable code.

⚙️ Architecture
🧱 Gate Stack
Gate	Function	Equivalent Component
PGN Intake Gate	Parses input PGN and validates format	Input Parser
Step-1 JSON Gate	Canonicalizes game data into structured JSON	Data Model
CSV Gate	Produces canonical CSV output	Export Layer
Commentary Gate (v1.3)	Generates multi-paragraph natural analysis	Analysis Engine
UX Gate (v1.2)	Presents persistent interaction interface	User Interface Layer
Post-PGN Cue	Signals state readiness	Runtime Logger
🔄 Execution Flow
```
PGN → JSON → CSV → Commentary → UX → User Query → UX (loop)
```

PGN Intake — Structured input via fenced tags (===PGN-START=== ... ===PGN-END===).

Step-1 JSON — Game reconstructed as canonical JSON with validation (FEN replay, tag audit).

CSV Emission — Produces export-ready record for Sheets or databases.

Commentary Generation — Multi-paragraph natural Markdown prose describing tactics and structure.

UX Gate Rendering — Presents clean, terminal-style interface with 5 selectable analysis options.

Reinforcement Loop — UX Gate persists, allowing repeated topic exploration without losing state.

🧮 State Management

State persistence is achieved through anchored context, not memory.

Each fenced section (JSON, CSV, Commentary, UX) acts as a semantic checkpoint.
Validated outputs become anchors, allowing subsequent reasoning to reference prior results deterministically.

Example:
```
===STEP1-JSON-START===
{...}
===STEP1-JSON-END===
```

This block anchors the parsed game state, which subsequent Commentary and UX Gates use as stable input.

🧠 Why It Matters

This system proves that complex, multi-phase reasoning can be achieved purely in natural language, without traditional code execution.

It showcases Context Anchoring’s potential as a computing model:

Deterministic reasoning within prompts.

Stateful, testable computation using anchors.

Validation cycles (audits) acting as runtime assertions.

Cross-Gate persistence forming logical software flow.

In short:
This chess bot doesn’t run code — it is the code.

🔍 Example Interaction
```
User: Okay, I am ready. Please paste a single-game PGN.
User: (pastes Carlsen–Niemann PGN)

→ PGN-INTAKE: tags=14, plies=114
→ JSON + CSV emitted
✅ PGN processed successfully.
Ask me what I thought of the game to begin commentary.

User: What did you think of the game?

→ Commentary Gate triggers:
   - Generates multi-paragraph analysis
   - Summarizes key strategic turning points
   - Outputs UX menu with topic options

User: 2
→ Returns detailed list of critical moments.
```

All logic and flow occur within the model — no backend required.

💡 Concept Summary

“Context Anchoring turns prompts into programmable systems.”

This project demonstrates that with precise language structure, a model like GPT-5 can behave as a deterministic software stack — parsing input, managing state, validating results, and interacting with users coherently across cycles.

It’s not a simulation of software — it’s software composed of reasoning.
